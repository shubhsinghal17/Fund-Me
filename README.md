# Fund-Me

It is a fund me app built using Solidity in which users can send funds using cryptocurrencies. Funders can fund to the contract owner any amount of ETH higher than the fund threshold($50) which can be set by the contract owner only and only the contract owner can widthraw these funds.

Just enter the amount of ethereum you want to fund in the value column(higher than $50) and click on fund.
Now you can check the amount funded by you by typing your address in "addressToAmountFunded" column or you can also check the amount funded by different funders by clicking on "funders" tab.
You can also check the fund threshold by clicking on "minimumUsd" column which is currently set to $50.
You can also check the owner's address by clicking on "owner" column

Not: only the owner of the contract can widthraw the funds.
